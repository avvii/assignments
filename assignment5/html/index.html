        <h1>C Programming</h1>
        <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was intially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, sample set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.</p>

        <h1>Python Programming</h1>
        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

        <h1>Java Programming</h1>
        <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. </p>
